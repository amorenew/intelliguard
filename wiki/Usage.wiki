First install !IntelliGuard with _IntelliJ IDEA plugin manager_. Search for *!IntelliGuard* among the available plugins, right-click on it and choose 'Download and install'. Then restart Intellij IDEA.

== Setting up !IntelliGuard ==

Add Obfuscation facet.

If you want obfuscate jars with !IntelliGuard this is the place to specify your yGuard installation path. You can enter the jar path manually or you can browse the filesystem by clicking the small button with three dots.

If you haven't got yGuard there is also a button which redirects to yGuard download page.

You will still able to use !IntelliGuard for generating and exporting obfuscation settings regardless if you have yGuard installed.

If your obfuscated jar file should be executable you may also specify the class which should be used as the _Main-Class_ attribute in the jar manifest. It can also be specified later (when running the 'Obfuscate module' action).

Finally, click the *OK* button and you are done.



== Configure Obfuscation ==

By default all class, field and method names will be obfuscated unless specified not to, or, in the case of a method, it extends or implements a method from a class defined outside of the module (for example in a library class).

Right-click in the editor gutter and choose 'Show Obfuscated symbols' in order to see which symbols will be obfuscated with current configuration. _Note: the gutter icons are toggled on a per-file basis._
